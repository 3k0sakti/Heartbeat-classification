A deep learning approach for ECG arrhythmia classification that combines handcrafted morphology features with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for improved accuracy and interpretability.

This code implements a hybrid machine learning model for automated ECG arrhythmia detection and classification. The system processes ECG signals from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and classifies heartbeats into 5 AAMI (Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation) standard classes.
